## LightVirtualMachine
VM for my best attempt of creating my own programming language.
The language is called Light and is heavily inspired by Java.
The basic concept and structure is also inspired by the JVM (like the class files).

It was fully functional to the point where it could dynamically load a Windows-DLL file and like a Light-function to a function in the DLL written in C.
This way I was able to print "HelloWorld" from my own VM.

Since I never wrote a compiler the class files were written using a hex-editor.
